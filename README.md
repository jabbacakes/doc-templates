# Documentation Templates

## What kind of content am I writing?
So you need to write some doc, but you can't even start with a template because you're not sure what kind of content it is? Working through these questions should help.

* Is what I'm trying to write about a step-by-step process? Does it have a clear beginning, middle, and end? ---> **Task**
* Am I just providing error codes, trace outputs, or other static data to the user? Is it likely to change substantially any time soon? If not, then probably ---> **Reference**
* Am I trying to explain a design decision, the context of a project, or the reasoning behind something? ---> **Concept**


* [Task](task-template.md)
* [Concept](concept-template.md)
* [Reference](reference-template.md)
* Table of Contents
