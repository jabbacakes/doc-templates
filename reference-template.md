## Reference Template
Content in {square brackets} are comments and should be deleted when using the template for realsies. Content in {curly brackets} should be replaced with whatever your content is.

# {Title}
{No strict rules for reference titles - just keep them as short as possible (like everything else), and make sure the key words your users will be looking for are in there.}

{Reference topics shouldn't require too much writing, mostly they should just be information dumps, tables, static info which users may need to refer to, but which is so specific that it should be pretty self-evident what it's for.}

{Introductory content goes here. Keep it short. Explain what the reference doc includes and maybe a short sentence on where/why users might encounter it.}

## Widget error codes
{Tables in markdown can be a PITA, I know. But [this tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) exists. The following is just an example of reference-type content.}

| Error  | Cause  |
|---|---|
| ERR  | No idea  |
| 404  | Missing page  |
| ðŸ”¥  | FIRE!  |

## Related topics
{Again, this is an optional section. But if there is other useful content, such as a troubleshooting page to resolve the error messages listed on a reference page, put it here.}
