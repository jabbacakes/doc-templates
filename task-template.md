## Task Template
Content in {curly brackets} is commentary, and should be deleted or replaced as appropriate when using these templates for realsies.

# {Title}
{Task titles should start with a gerund, an 'ing' word. Examples: 'Installing the widget', 'Configuring the widget', 'Setting fire to the widget when it misbehaves'. If you cannot title your task this way, maybe it isn't actually a task?}

{Introductory content goes here, shouldn't be longer than a paragraph. Tell users what this page shows them how to do, and what the expected outcome is. Include here any warnings, if appropriate.}

## Prerequisites
{Anything users need to do/have/install before starting this task. Link here to other tasks they need to complete first, if appropriate, such as 'Installing the widget' if your current task is 'Configuring the widget'.}

## Steps
{Always use numbered lists for task steps, never bullet points. Have as many steps as you need, but use your judgement. If the page is getting very long, maybe you should split it into two task pages instead.}

{
1. Step one
    1. {Sub-steps are fine, although if you have lots of them then you might be trying to cover too much on one page.}
2. Step two
3. Step three
4. Step four

}

## Result
{Explain the expected outcome. This allows users to know if something went wrong.}

## Next steps
{Delete this section if not relevant. But if this is a series of tasks such as 'Installing the widget', 'Configuring the widget', 'Using the widget', consider linking to the next task here to help users know where to go next.}

## Troubleshooting
{Again, delete if not relevant, or there are no standardised ways to troubleshoot if this task goes wrong. Keep this section short. If you can't explain in a few sentences how to troubleshoot problems with the task, consider creating a troubleshooting page to link to.}
