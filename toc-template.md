## Table of Contents Template
As ever, this is merely a template. The table of contents (toc) is probably the thing that varies the most between documentation bases. If in doubt, go check the doc which you've found most useful as a developer - see how that's structured and emulate it where useful.

Generally, your documentation should start with some concepts as you introduce your project, then be mostly tasks in the middle as you show people how to use it (and maybe some more involved concept topics, _if_ they are useful for users), and then finish up with reference content. It's almost like a timeline: your users are total noobs at the start, and as they work down the toc they know more and more about your project. You may need lots more headings than given below - sub-headings are your friend.
