## Concept Template
Content in {curly brackets} is commentary, and should be deleted or replaced as appropriate when using these templates for realsies.

# {Title}
{No strict rules for concept titles - just keep them as short as possible (like everything else), and make sure the key words your users will be looking for are in there.}

{Concepts are one of the trickier types of content to write, since they can take many forms. Generally speaking, stick to one topic per concept page, use subheadings and structure as much as possible to help break up content, and always remember that you're writing for the user. Is this information helpful for the user, do they need to know this, how does it benefit them? Think of a concept page as answering a 'what is?' question.}

{Introductory content goes here. Keep it short.}

## {What is the widget?}

## {What are the benefits of the widget?}

## {Why is the widget built the way it is?}

{All of the above subheading are just suggestions, you may find you don't use any of them in some concepts.}

## Related topics
{This is optional, but if there's any content in your doc which is related to the concept you just wrote, link to it here. Don't make users go hunting for it.}
